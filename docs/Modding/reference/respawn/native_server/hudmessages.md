# HUD Messages

Functions to render text on the client screen.

Because these can not be removed in demos and are somewhat ugly, **it is
recommended to use**
`Serverside RUI <serverside-rui-doc>` 
**instead**

> Send a HUD message to the given player.

> Send a HUD message to all players.

> Prints white text in the center of the screen on all clients.
