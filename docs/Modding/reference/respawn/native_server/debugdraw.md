# Debug Drawing

!!! note


Only `DebugDrawLine <DebugDrawLine>` ,
`DebugDrawBox <DebugDrawBox>`  and
`DebugDrawScreenText <DebugDrawScreenText>` are native functions.

The rest are defined in scripts using these.
::::

In Titanfall it is possible to draw shapes in 3D, from the SERVER and
CLIENT VM, using the debug draw functions, however in order for them to
actually render you will need to set `sv_cheats 1` and
`enable_debug_overlays 1` in your launch config or console.

These debug drawing functions are available:

# DebugDrawLine

# DebugDrawBox

# DebugDrawScreenText
