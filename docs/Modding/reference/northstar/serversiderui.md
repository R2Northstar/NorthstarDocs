# Serverside RUI {#serverside-rui-doc}

Server-side Rui provides a set of functions enabling servers to display
complex hud elements on clients without requiring a client-side mod.
These functions were introduced in Northstar `1.10.0`.

It should be noted that there's no guarantee the client will see the hud
elements.

## Polls

Creates a poll on `player`.

**Definition:**

**Example:**

``` 
void function CreateDummyPoll()
 {
    array<string> options = [ "Vote for a map!", "Amongsus", "sussy", "when", "1.10", "hi H0l0" ]
    foreach(entity player in GetPlayerArray())
        NSCreatePollOnPlayer(player, "Vote who's the biggest dummy!", options, 30)
  }
```

### Getting Response

**Definition:**

Returns the index of the item from `options` the player voted for. If
the player hadn\'t voted yet it returns a -1.

**Example:**

``` 
void function CheckResponseToDummyPoll(entity player)
{
    if(NSGetPlayerResponse(player) != -1)
        print("Player has voted!")
}
```

## Large Message

Sends a large message to `player` which will appear in the top right
corner.

}
```

## Info Message

Sends a smaller message to `player` which will appear from the center
right.

{
    NSSendInfoMessageToPlayer(player, "we were sent at the same time but I was sent sooner")
}
```

## PopUp

Send a small popup to `player` which will appear in the lower half of
their screen under their cursor.

## Announcement

void function SendDummyAnnouncement(entity player)
{
    NSSendAnnouncementMessageToPlayer(player, "Very cool announcement", "Hi Karma", <1,1,0>, 1, ANNOUNCEMENT_STYLE_QUICK)
}
```

## Status

Status messages allow you to show live data to the player. Currently
status messages are limited to 4 and there\'s no way to know if the
player can see your message.

<figure class="screenshotalign-center">
<img src="/_static/serversiderui/status.gif" class="screenshot"
alt="/_static/serversiderui/status.gif" />
<figcaption>Player POV</figcaption>
</figure>

**Definitions:**

Creates a status message on `player`. `id` is used to identify and edit
the message, make sure your id is unique! To generate a unique id, use
UniqueString().

Allows for editing of the `title` and `description` of a message which
was created using `id`.

Deletes the status message which was created with `id`

**Examples:**

``` 
void function TestStatusMessage_Threaded(entity player)
{
    string id = UniqueString("votes#")
    NSCreateStatusMessageOnPlayer(player, "have voted", "[0/12]", id)
    wait 3
    NSEditStatusMessageOnPlayer(player, "have voted", "[1/12]", id)
    wait 10
    NSDeleteStatusMessageOnPlayer(player, id)    
}
```
