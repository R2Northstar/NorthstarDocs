# Plugins

Plugins are native modules loaded by Northstar. Because they're not limited to any API provided by the game, plugins are a powerful tool to enable you to do almost anything you could with a custom Northstar Client.

For example, you could write a plugin that [compiles maps](https://github.com/catornot/furnace) at runtime, allows squirrel scripts to save and load recorded animations [from disk](https://github.com/uniboi/recanim) or provide [discord rpc](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarDiscordRPC) integration.

However because plugins have full access to your system plugins should be treated with caution and regular scripts are preferred if possible.
