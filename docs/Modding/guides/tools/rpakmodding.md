# RPak Modding

## What Are RPaks/Starpaks?

`.rpak` files are a file format created by Respawn as the main way to store and load in-game assets, such as textures, materials, datatables, animation recordings, etc.
The assets in the `.rpak` file are kept stored in memory as long as the `.rpak` file is loaded.

`.starpak` files are another file format created by Respawn to complement the `.rpak` file format.
They contain streamed asset data, saving hardware resources by only loading the data when needed.
The most common example of streamed asset data is high resolution textures. The low resolution versions are kept permanently loaded in a `.rpak` file, whilst the higher resolution versions are loaded as needed.

## RePak First-Time Setup

The lastest RePak release can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/r-ex/RePak/releases).
Once it has been downloaded, it is recommended to set up your file structure as follows:

```text
RePak
├── RePak.exe
├── repak_map.json 
└── assets
```

- `RePak`: the base folder where your RePak/RPak related files go
- `RePak.exe`: the `unzipped` file you downloaded from GitHub
- `repak_map.json`: the repak map you will use, you can name this json whatever you want 
- `assets`: the folder where you will put your various different images and folders, used to create your RPaks

see [Repak](../../repak/index.md) for more info on how to setup your repak map 

### Using the RPak in a mod

Create the basis of the mod using the [Getting Started](../gettingstarted.md) guide.

Inside the mod's folder, create a new folder, called `paks`. Move your `.rpak` file (and `.starpak` files if you have any) into the folder.

![ModStructure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66967891/181840035-3cfa24e0-efdd-49fa-85f6-60e6c4cc9a12.png)

Inside the `paks` folder that you created, make a new `.json` file called `rpak.json`.
In this example, the `camo_skin04_col.rpak` rpak is completely replaced by `example.rpak`.
This is fine for camo RPaks, but isn't suitable for more complex RPaks

```json
{
    "Preload":
    {
        "example.rpak": false
    },
    "Aliases":
    {
        "camo_skin04_col.rpak": "example.rpak"
    },
    "Postload":
    {

    }
}
```

- `Preload`: if set to `true` this makes RPaks get loaded as soon as possible.
- `Aliases`: this completely replaces the RPak with the specified RPak. In this example `camo_skin04_col.rpak` is replaced by `example.rpak`.
- `Postload`: this makes RPaks get loaded directly after the specified RPak.

#### Preload

This field tells Northstar whether or not to load a specific RPak as soon as RPak loading starts.

The field is a boolean. (`true` or `false`) and should be formatted like `"<target_rpak>": true` or `"<target_rpak>": false`

Example: `"my_new.rpak": true`

#### Aliases

This field tells Northstar that a specific RPak should never be loaded, and a different RPak should be loaded instead.

The field should be formatted like `"<target_rpak>": "<replacement_rpak>"`

Example: `"common.rpak": "my_new.rpak"`

#### Postload

This field tells Northstar that a specific RPak must be loaded directly after another specified RPak has finished loading.

The field should be formatted like `"<target_rpak>": "<rpak_to_load_after>"`

Example: `"my_new.rpak": "common.rpak"`

!!! warning
    If an asset in your RPak references another asset, it must be loaded after the asset that it references, or the game will infinitely loop when launched.
    This is mostly a problem for `matl` assets, `txtr` assets don't reference other assets.

The file structure of your `paks` folder should be similar to this:

![PaksStructure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66967891/181840126-98e48860-84d0-496d-8f2e-1cea4dea7363.png)

```text
paks
├── example.rpak
├── example.starpak
└── rpak.json
```

- `example.rpak`: this is the RPak file that you made.
- `rpak.json`: this controls how the game loads your RPak files

**After** `rpak.json` **is set up correctly, your RPak mod should be complete and functional!**

!!! note
    If when you test the rpak the colour looks weird, use SRGB in the `.dds` compression, or use non-SRGB if you were already using SRGB
