Weapon and key value modding ===========================

# Weapon Modding

Do keep in mind that these are usually changed server-side.

To actually change the keyvalues of weapons you\'d have to name them
appropriately inside a mod folder For example:
`R2Northstar\mods\Northstar.Custom\keyvalues\scripts\weapons` You can
find all the weapon keyvalues
[here](https://github.com/BigSpice/TitanFall_2_Weapon_Skin_Modding/tree/main/Weapon_Scripts)

Example for modding crossshairs using keyvalues:
`crosshairmodding` 

-   Mod Examples:
    -   [Northstar.Custom](https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarMods/tree/main/Northstar.Custom)
    -   [Unholy
        Trinity](https://github.com/xamionex/xamionex.UnholyTrinity)
    -   [Kraber9K](https://github.com/Steveplays28/kraber9k)
