# Creating / Manipulating Objects

## Arrays


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT newarray(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, const SQInteger size = 0)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` the target vm
    - `SQInteger size` initial size of the array

    Returns a `SQRESULT`

    creates a new array and pushes it to the stack

    ```cpp

        newarray(sqvm, 0);
        pushstring(sqvm, "val1");
        arrayappend(sqvm, -2);
        pushinteger(sqvm, 15);
        arrayappend(sqvm, -2);

        /*
            The array on the stack now looks like this:
            [ "val1", 15 ]
        */
    ```



!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT arrayappend(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, const SQInteger stackpos)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` the target vm
    - `SQInteger stackpos` stack position of the array to append to
    - Returns a `SQRESULT`

    pops a value from the stack and pushes it to the back of the array at the position idx in the stack

## Tables


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT newtable(HSquirrelVM* sqvm)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` the target vm

    Returns a `SQRESULT`

    creates a new table and pushes it onto the stack.


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT newslot(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, SQInteger stackpos, SQBool bstatic)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` the target vm
    - `SQInteger stackpos` the index of the table to insert into
    - `SQBool bstatic` if `SQTrue` creates a static member. This parameter is only used if the target object is a class.

    pops a key and a value from the stack and performs a set operation on the table or class that is at position idx in the stack, if the slot does not exist it will be created.

    ```cpp

        newtable(sqvm);
        // slot 1
        pushstring(sqvm, "key");
        pushstring(sqvm, "value");
        newslot(sqvm, -3);
        // slot 2
        pushstring(sqvm, "key2");
        pushasset(sqvm, "value2");
        newslot(sqvm, -3);
        // slot 3
        pushstring(sqvm, "key3");
        newtable(sqvm);
        pushstring(sqvm, "sub");
        pushinteger(sqvm, 13);
        newslot(sqvm, -3);
        newslot(sqvm, -3);

        /*
            The table on the stack now looks like this:
            {
                key = "value"
                key2 = $"value2"
                key3 = { sub = 13 }
            }
        */
    ```

## Structs

!!! note

    These functions aren't available for plugins yet.


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT::SQRESULT_NULL pushnewstructinstance(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, int fieldCount)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` The target vm
    - `int fieldCount` total number of fields the struct contains
    
    Creates and pushes a struct instance with `fieldCount` to the stack.


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT::SQRESULT_NULL sealstructslot(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, int fieldIndex)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` The target vm
    - `int fieldIndex` Index of the field to fill

    Pops a value from the stack and fills the field at `fieldIndex` from the struct object that needs to be at the top of the stack.

    ```cpp

        pushnewstructinstance(sqvm, 2); // create a struct instance with 2 slots
        pushinteger(sqvm, 12);
        sealstructslot(sqvm, 0);
        pushstring(sqvm, "example", -1);
        sealstructslot(sqvm, 1);

        /*
            Assuming the compiler expects this slot:
            struct ExStruct { int i, string s }
            , the struct on the stack looks like this

            ExStruct {
                i = 12,
                s = "example"
            }
        */
    ```

# Userdata


!!! cpp-function "T* createuserdata(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, SQInteger size)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` The target vm
    - `SQInteger size` bit size of the userdata object

    When the function sq_newuserdata is called,
    Squirrel allocates a new userdata with the specified size,
    returns a pointer to his payload buffer and push the object in the stack;
    at this point the application can do whatever it want with this memory chunk,
    the VM will automatically take care of the memory deallocation like for every other built-in type.
    A userdata can be passed to a function or stored in a table slot. By default Squirrel cannot manipulate directly userdata;
    however is possible to assign a delegate to it and define a behavior like it would be a table.
    Because the application would want to do something with the data stored in a userdata object when it get deleted,
    is possible to assign a callback that will be called by the VM just before deleting a certain userdata.
    This is done through the API call sq_setreleasehook.


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT setuserdatatypeid(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, const SQInteger stackpos, uint64_t typeId)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` The target vm
    - `SQInteger stackpos` Stack position of the userdata


!!! cpp-function "SQRESULT getuserdata(HSquirrelVM* sqvm, const SQInteger stackpos, T* data, uint64_t* typeId)"

    - `HSquirrelVM* sqvm` The target vm
    - `SQInteger stackpos` Stack position of the userdata
    - `T* data` Pointer to an arbitrary variable the userdata gets mapped to
    - `uint64_t* typeid` Pointer to a variable edited to hold the userdata type
